 Some coding challenges my teacher sent me
# [The website link](https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/202838-20-code-challenges.pdf)
## Disclaimer: You will need to create all the json files yourself, here is a guide: 
### Create a folder in the source directory called "json"
### Inside this folder, create a json file with the name of the challenge e.g. averages becomes averages.json (Not all of the challenges requiere a .json file, check the "JSON_PATH" variable)
### Inside the new json file, put a {}
## Done!

~~I have a method naming problem~~
