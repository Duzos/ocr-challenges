 Some coding challenges my teacher sent me
# [The website link](https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/202838-20-code-challenges.pdf)
# Disclaimer: You will need to create all the json files yourself, here is a guide:
## Create a folder in the source directory called "json"
## Inside this folder, create a json file with the name of the challenge e.g. averages becomes averages.json
## Inside the new json file, put a {}
# Done!
